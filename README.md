# recommender_systems

This repository presents a series of tutorials in regards to how to develop recommender systems using different techniques.
It simply starts from exploring MovieLens open-source dataset until building different recommenders namely: Simple recommender system using the IMDB weighted rating formula for generating a score for each movie, Content-based recommenders (Plot description-based recommender & Metadata-based recommender) using cosine similarity, Collaborative recommenders and Hybrid recommenders.

The aforementioned dataset can be found at the following url: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset and contains metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017 containing information about budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts, vote averages etc.
